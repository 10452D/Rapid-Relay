## What's here?

This repository contains all programs created by the team as part of this season, and serves to document the iterative engineering process used. We've used the following structure to keep things organized at a high level

```
blocks_projects/      Contains any VEXCode IQ Blocks Projects
|-> integrated/       Contains blocks projects meant for overall control of the robot
|-> submodules/       Contains blocks projects only meant to control one portion of the robot
|-> sandbox/          Contains blocks projects used for learning concepts and anything else not related to the competition robot
python_projects/      Contains any VEXCode IQ Python Projects
|-> integrated/       Contains Python projects meant for overall control of the robot
|-> submodules/       Contains Python projects only meant to control one portion of the robot
|-> sandbox/          Contains Python projects used for learning concepts and anything else not related to the competition robot
